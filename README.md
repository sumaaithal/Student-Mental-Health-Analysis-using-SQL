### Student-Mental-Health-Analysis-using-SQL

🧠 Overview

Studying abroad can be an exciting adventure—but it also presents unique challenges. Recognizing this, a Japanese international university conducted a study to better understand the mental health of its international student population.

This project explores the results of that study using SQL-based data analysis. The goal is to identify which factors—such as language proficiency, social connectedness, academic level, or duration of stay—might influence mental health outcomes like depression or acculturative stress.


🎯 Objectives
	•	Analyze the relationship between mental health indicators (depression, social connectedness, acculturative stress) and student background.
	•	Understand how language proficiency, academic level, age, and length of stay correlate with mental health outcomes.
	•	Use SQL queries to derive insights from the dataset and prepare summaries useful for student wellness programs.

📊 Dataset Columns

Column Name: Description
inter_dom: Type of student (international or domestic)
japanese_cate: Japanese language proficiency category
english_cate: English language proficiency category
academic: Academic level (undergraduate or graduate)
age: Age of the student
stay: Duration of stay in Japan (in years)
todep: Depression score (PHQ-9)
tosc: Social connectedness score (SCS)
toas: Acculturative stress score (ASISS)

🔍 Skills Demonstrated
	•	Writing intermediate SQL queries to filter, group, and summarize complex data.
	•	Performing aggregations, conditional filtering, and rounding.
	•	Translating mental health study questions into analytical queries.
	•	Presenting data-driven insights that can inform institutional support services.


## 💡 Key Questions Explored

- Do students with low Japanese or English proficiency show higher depression or stress scores?
- How does academic level or age relate to social connectedness?
- Are international students with longer stays experiencing less acculturative stress?
- Which English proficiency groups report the highest mental health challenges?
- How does age distribution influence levels of social connectedness among students?
